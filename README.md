This project involved developing and programming an autonomous VEX robot to simulate a forklift operating within a warehouse environment. The goal was for the robot to accurately pick up and drop off a fragile payload while navigating obstacles, all within a 120-second timeframe. To achieve precise and reliable movement, the team implemented a closed-loop control system using PI (Proportional-Integral) controllers, encoders, and sonar and light sensors. These systems allowed the robot to self-correct for issues such as motor mismatch, backlash, and sensor interference, which had been challenges in previous iterations. 

The solution included multiple custom functions for navigation, payload handling, and line followingâ€”each carefully tuned for performance. Although the robot performed well overall and met the core objectives, some bugs and timing issues prevented the team from achieving the time bonus during observation. Nevertheless, the team reflected on potential improvements and concluded that their solution was scalable and met the needs of the brief.
